    <string name="description">This is a simple calculator designed to highlight the real cost of purchases when compared to your net income. I often fall into the trap of, \"I made X amount this month, of course I can afford this!\" while conveniently forgetting my bills.\n\nThe formula is a straight percentage multiplier. For example, if your income is $2000 and your expenses are $1500, you are left with $500. A $20 purchase would thus, relative to your net income, cost four times as much, or $80. </string>
